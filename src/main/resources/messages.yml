# HOW TO USE PLACEHOLDERS
#
# Every message has a comment like this one with what placeholders it has access to.
# You can use a placeholder by putting curly brackets around the placeholder name
#
# Example:
# Data: player = steve, balance = 153
# Message: {Player} has a balance of {balance}
# Result: steve has a balance of 153
